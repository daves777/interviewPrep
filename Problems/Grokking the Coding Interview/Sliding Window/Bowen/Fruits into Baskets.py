# Problem:
# You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees.
# You are given two baskets. Your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
# You are given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. These are the rules:

# 1. Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
# 2. You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
# 3. You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot (Stop when you have to pick a third fruit type)

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

# Problem:
# Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number S find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray
# whose sum is greater than or equal to S. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

# Solution:
# This is similar to Maximum Sum Subarray of size K, except the window size is not fixed.

# Steps:
# 1. Add elements from array until window sum becomes greater than or equal to S. Remember length of window as smallest window so far
# 2. Shrink window by subtracting first element until windowâ€™s sum is smaller than S again.
# 3. Check if current window length is smallest so far
# 4. Keep adding one element to sliding window in stepwise fashion

# Time Complexity: O(N)
# The outer for loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once.
# This makes the time complexity O(N + N), which is equivalent to O(N)

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# We only keep track of one window sum throughout
